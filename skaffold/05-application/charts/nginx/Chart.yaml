# INCIDENT 70 FIX: common-ssl dependency removed - migrated to cert-manager
# Note: common-secrets dependency removed to eliminate cross-namespace ownership conflicts
# Secrets are now managed centrally via the deploy-cli tool
# SSL certificates are now managed by cert-manager in the foundation layer
