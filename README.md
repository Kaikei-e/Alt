# Alt

*The local-first, composable RSS knowledge pipeline.*

Alt is a self-hosted RSS reader and “content refinery” that fetches feeds, scrubs & tags articles, indexes them for lightning-fast search and serves a clean reading UI – everything running in neatly isolated containers so you can swap parts out or scale them independently.
The project is built **mobile-first**, 100 % open-source (Apache-2.0), and engineered around a five-layer flavour of Clean Architecture with test-driven development at its core.

Each service runs in its own container so components can be scaled or swapped independently. The containers communicate over an internal Docker network and can be started with a single `docker compose up` command.

## Project Characteristics

- Embraces a microservice approach where small, focused containers cooperate via HTTP and message passing.
- Clean Architecture principles guide the main Go services, keeping business rules isolated from infrastructure.
- Test-driven development and automated health checks help maintain reliability.
- The system is designed to be composable: you can replace any service (for example, the search engine or tag generator) without affecting the rest of the pipeline.

## Backend Processing Flow

The backend is a pipeline of microservices that work together to fetch, process, and index content from RSS feeds. Each service is a container that communicates with others over the network.

### Flow Description

1. **Feed Registration**: A user submits a new RSS feed URL through the **alt-frontend**.
1. **Save Feed URL**: The **alt-backend** receives the URL and saves it to the `feed_links` table in the **PostgreSQL** database.
1. **Article Fetching**: The **pre-processor** service periodically fetches new articles from the registered feed URLs.
1. **Save Articles**: The fetched articles are parsed and stored in the `articles` table in the database.
1. **Article Summarization**: The **pre-processor** sends the content of new articles to the **news-creator** service.
1. **Return Summary**: The **news-creator**, using an LLM (Phi-3-mini), generates a summary and returns it.
1. **Save Summary**: The **pre-processor** saves the summary to the `article_summaries` table.
1. **Tag Generation**: The **tag-generator** service fetches articles that haven’t been tagged yet.
1. **Generate & Save Tags**: It uses an ML model to generate tags from the article’s content and saves them to the `article_tags` and `feed_tags` tables.
1. **Search Indexing**: The **search-indexer** service fetches new and updated articles from the database.
1. **Index Articles**: It sends the article data to **Meilisearch** for indexing.
1. **Frontend API**: The **alt-backend** provides a REST API for the **alt-frontend** to display feeds, articles, and search results.
1. **Search API**: When a user searches, the **alt-backend** queries the **Meilisearch** index and returns the results.
