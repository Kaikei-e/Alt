# Alt

_The local-first, composable RSS knowledge pipeline._

Alt is a self-hosted RSS reader and “content refinery” that fetches feeds, scrubs & tags articles, indexes them for lightning-fast search and serves a clean reading UI – everything running in neatly isolated containers so you can swap parts out or scale them independently.
The project is built **mobile-first**, 100 % open-source (Apache-2.0), and engineered around a five-layer flavour of Clean Architecture with test-driven development at its core.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
