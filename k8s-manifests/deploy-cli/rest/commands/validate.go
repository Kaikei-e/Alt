This command performs comprehensive pre-deployment validation including:
• Required command availability (helm, kubectl)
• Kubernetes cluster accessibility and permissions
• Chart configuration and template validation
• Storage infrastructure prerequisites  
• Secret state validation and conflict detection
• Namespace and resource prerequisites

Secret Validation:
Includes automatic secret validation to identify potential deployment issues
before they occur, similar to the validation performed during deployment.

Examples:
  # Validate production environment (recommended before deployment)
  deploy-cli validate production

  # Validate development environment
  deploy-cli validate development

  # Validate staging environment  
  deploy-cli validate staging

Use Cases:
• Pre-deployment verification in CI/CD pipelines
• Troubleshooting deployment preparation issues
• Verifying environment setup after infrastructure changes
• Confirming readiness before production deployments`,
